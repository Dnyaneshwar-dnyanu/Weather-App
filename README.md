## My process

<h3 id="built-with">🛠️ Built with</h3>

* Semantic **HTML5** markup
* **CSS3** (Flexbox, CSS Grid, custom properties, responsive design)
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)** for dynamic features
* **Open-Meteo API** for real-time weather data
* **OpenStreetMap API** for location search and mapping
* **Mobile-first workflow**

---

<h3 id="what-i-learned">📚 What I learned</h3>

Working on this project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

* Fetching and handling **API data** (weather + maps)
* Implementing **voice search** for user convenience
* Designing an **immersive and responsive UI**
* Handling **unit conversions** for weather metrics
* Optimizing layout for desktop and mobile

---

<h3 id="continued-development">🚀 Continued development</h3>

In future updates, I’d like to:

* Add **dark/light theme toggle**
* Show **weather alerts** if available
* Improve **accessibility (a11y)** for screen readers
* Add **animations** for smoother transitions
